## Workflow

### Definition of branches

Branch `main` is the place where holds stable code.
Branch `beta` is the place where holds codes which are needed to test.

### Start to work

When developers start to develop a new feature, create a new branch with `git checkout` command from [Jira](https://nghiatvtfpt.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SU2201/boards/1) (this includes the name of that feature).

After developed, push your code to branch `beta` and inform QA/QC for testing your code.

After testing phase complete, create **merge request** from your branch into `main` to deploy stable code.
